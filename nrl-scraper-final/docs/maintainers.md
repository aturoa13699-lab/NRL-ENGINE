# Maintainers Guide - Branch Protection & Required Checks

## Protect `main`
1. Settings -> Branches -> Add rule: `main`
2. Require:
   - Status checks to pass before merging:
     - `ci` (or at least the `test` job)
   - Require pull request reviews (>=1)
   - Require branches to be up to date before merging
   - Optional: Require signed commits

## Labels and PR hygiene
- Run **Sync Labels** (Actions) once to seed standard labels.
- PRs auto-labeled by path via **Labeler**.
- PR titles should follow Conventional Commits: `feat: ...`, `fix: ...`, `chore: ...`

## Releases
- Tag: `git tag vX.Y.Z && git push origin vX.Y.Z`
- Notes generated by **Release Drafter** from commits/labels.

## Local dev
